It may not sound like much to some people, but for me it's a big step forward.</p><p>I used to play too fast and panic in winning positions, but I've started to focus more on <strong>time management</strong> and simplifying when ahead. Here are a few things that helped me:</p><ul><li>⏱️ Don’t panic when low on time — just play instinctively</li><li>♟️ Trade down when ahead — less pieces = fewer blunders</li><li>👀 Always check for hanging pieces!</li></ul><p>Next goal: 1100!</p><p><em>Feel free to challenge me on Lichess or Chess.com!</em></p><img src=\"assets/images/chessr.PNG\" class=\"img-fluid rounded mt-3\" alt=\"Chess rating 1000 reached\">"
